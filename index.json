Currently, we have developed two types of reward functions: 1) reward function reflecting deviations from human driving performance, leading to human-like car following; and 2) reward function reflecting driving efficiency, safety, and comfort, leading to multi-objective autonomous car-following.\nThe following demo animation shows the car-following learning process of RL agents. In early training episodes, cars become red frequently, indicating penalties caused by bad car-following performance, e.g., rear-end crashes. As training converges, the RL agents maintain steady car-following headways, and receive fewer penalties.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://zhengleily.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"An example of using the in-built project page.","tags":["Autonomous Driving"],"title":"AUTONOMOUS CAR CRUISE BASED ON SAFE LEARNING","type":"project"},{"authors":["Lei Zheng","Rui Yang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, it is still challenging to use learning-based methods under uncertain environments while stability, safety, and real-time performance of the system are desired to guarantee. In this letter, we propose a learning-based tracking control scheme based on a feedback linearization controller in which uncertain disturbances are approximated online using Gaussian Processes (GPs). Using the predicted distribution of disturbances given by GPs, a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) based Quadratic Program is applied, with which probabilistic stability and safety are guaranteed. In addition, the trajectory is optimized first by Model Predictive Control (MPC) based on the linearized dynamics systems to further reduce the tracking error. We also design an event trigger for GPs updates to improve efficiency while stability and safety of the system are still guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed tracking control strategy is illustrated in numerical simulations.","tags":[],"title":"Safe learning-based tracking control for quadrotors under wind disturbances","type":"publication"}]
